========== CONFIGURATION

The solver can be build as sequential solver (riss) or for multi-threading
using the portfolio approach (priss). For both variants, building and running
the solver is described below.

========== BUILDING

riss:
Run "make riss" in the root directory.

priss:
Run "make priss" in the root directory.

Note: You may add "-j" to the make parameters, because building the solver
uses a lot of time. Furthermore, if riss has been build, you have make sure
that you run "make clean" before compiling priss, and the other way aroung.

========== RUNNING
riss:
./riss problem.cnf solution.cnf

priss:
./priss problem.cnf solution.cnf

Note: For more information and parameters of the solver run the solver with
the parameter "-h" (basic help) or "--help" (very verbose help on configuration
of the solver).

Note: priss uses usually 4 threads for solving. You can change the number of used
thread by adding the parameters "-PNW_threads X" to the commandline, where X
represents the number of threads that should be used.
